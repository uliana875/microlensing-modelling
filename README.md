# microlensing-modelling
 
Constantly evolving code for modeling the microlensing events:

- Point source point lens (PSPL) and finite source point lens (FSPL) models available,
- Models with the parallax,
- Easy plotting,
- Easy BHTOM data preprocessing.

[MulensModel](https://github.com/rpoleski/MulensModel) and [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) packages are used.
